### Student Record II

Write a CLI program that reads scoring records of students, and prints out a summary sheet in the same format with the last homework "Students I". 


The user can input an arbitrary number of students. Each student can take an arbitrary number of courses.


Each record consists of the course id/name and the score the student got. Please note that a student usually won't choose every available course.
